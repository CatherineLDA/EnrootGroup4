# Art Jamming: TOTE-ally Yours <3
This website serves as a gallery where participants can showcase their unique tote bag designs and explore the creations of others. Participants can vote for their favourite designs by clicking the "Vote Now!" button, and the top three designs with the most votes will win prizes.

This project uses React, TypeScript, and Vite for the frontend, with Supabase as the backend database.
